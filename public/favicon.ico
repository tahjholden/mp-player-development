I cannot directly generate a binary favicon.ico file through text, as it requires image data in the ICO format. A favicon.ico file is a binary file containing one or more small images at different sizes (typically 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels).

For your black and gold favicon, I recommend:

1. Use an online favicon generator like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
2. Create a simple design with:
   - Black (#000000) background
   - Old Gold (#CFB53B) foreground - perhaps a simple "P" or player silhouette
3. Download the generated .ico file
4. Place it in your project's public directory as favicon.ico

Alternatively, you could create a simple SVG or PNG first in any design tool, then convert it to ICO format using these same online tools.

The favicon should match your application's black and gold theme for brand consistency across browser tabs and bookmarks.
